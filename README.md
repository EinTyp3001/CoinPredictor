# CoinPredictor

Let gpt4all create a python script that scrapes the headlines published within the last 24 hours of ten crypto websites and make a prediction on what crypto coin will go up and what down within the next 24 hours. 

step 1: scrape headlines and save locally. 
step 2: evaluate the headlines, identify coins and make a prediction
step 3: output a recommendation what to short/long for 24 hours. 
step 4: test-mode, let it save the results and make comparison every 24h. let it run for 2 weeks. 
step 5: evaluate. 

lets go.
